                    My name is Ziqi Fang, a 16 yrs old child from China which now, lives in LA. I'm currently in 11th grade, well at least, in a month I will be in. My parents are so dedicated for me to learn coding and literaly send me here without even asking about my opinion. They thought that I would have fun and moked me for denying so early. To be honest, I come here just for the classes, being around people really turns me down. I do not understand why are they so happy about.

                        <li>I did not like being around too much people</li>
                        <li>I like meaningful classes</li>

                             At the first day, I have recognized a extremely important point. I do not have the will to interact with anyone in all conditions while I have to because it's a summer camp, it's meant to be like that. So I tried my best to support the fake smile on my face to everyone. And it comes to the first day of classes. There's this one blonde girl which went to the wrong class and ends up just hanging around on the first class. Other than that, I met my teachers in html and unity, which is Mr. Tyrone and Ms. Claire, both language gives me a brand new vision on coding which I have never seen before since I only have a month of experiences on python. And it seems like it's hard for both sides either to teach or to learn. The basic education on coding is different for everyone, this two Taiwanese are just so good at this and eventually gets way ahead which ends up playing games to get rid of boredness. That made a huge contrast to me, which still strugglling to open the software.

                            After class, everyone is signing up for those special events, while I desided to just chill in my room. Why? Cause I have a holiday lag. When I stayed at home, I could sleep for 12 hours straight ahead, but here, I have to wake up at 9 to get to class. Just so you know, that's hell to me. My maximum focus time is like an hour and half. There's just two hour of class right there.

                            Well, as I said, I do not like to be around people, while I kinda still made like few friends, one of the kid study in China and have a fluent Chinese speaking, we just kind of talked cause we both know Chinese. Guys here are just so dedicated to get girls which is extremely disturbing. They are still talking with girl in the public area at like 1am and playing some loud ass music. The food here is really good BTW, which attract me the most, they have like different choice on which part of world's food you want, that kills me. At the last day, I have just found out that there's piano houses in this collage, and I missed it for 2 weeks, I could'v had a lot of fun with it, but probably next years.
